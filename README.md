### The Woodsmen

_The Woodsmen_ is an [ArmA 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ArmA_2) mission in which a group of stout, whole-hearted Chernarus lumberjacks band together to help their fellow Chernarussians. It's meant for cooperative play with a small group of friends.

### Whole-map dynamic mini-missions which take a bit of thought

Many ArmA players enjoy long-running, ever-changing, "dynamic" missions which involve completing objectives or "side missions" all over the game world. Some also find fun in managing the logistics of an operation -- which munitions do we need, how much do they cost, and how much fuel do we need to get there and back?

For small groups of friends, though, there aren't many missions which combine these two aspects of gameplay in a way that's fun for just a couple of people. Traditional small-group missions are usually one-off, linear experiences with limited replay value. And game modes like Warfare and [Multi-Session Operations](http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=13336), while fun, tend to cheapen the logistics side because they aren't balanced for so few players.

That's where _The Woodsmen_ comes in. It combines the dynamic, "mini mission" premise with logistics balanced for you and your friends. This means features like:

* Receiving missions from Oleg, your leader, at your woodcutter's camp.
* Starting with little equipment, funds or reputation (you're a lumberjack!) and gradually building prestige and resources through your successes.
* Needing to purchase weapons, ammunition, fuel, maps, compasses and other supplies using the funds you earn -- and balancing these costs with your friends to complete missions and get your valuable equipment back to your camp.
